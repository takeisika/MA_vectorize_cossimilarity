I need to reset my entire life right now. Because this is driving me insane. So basically today I'm gonna show you my like Sunday reset routine. So these are things that I try to do every Sunday to kind of like get my life together like get my life back on track so that I can prepare for the next week and have a really great next week. But anyway let's get started. So actually the first thing that I do every Sunday morning is I refill my daily pill off so I take my antidepressants every morning along with probiotics. These are the ones from seed and I also take 2000 IU of vitamin D because I have the deficiency. If you're a brown or black person of color make sure you get your vitamin D level checked because we are both at risk for vitamin D. Efficiency, one of the only downsides of having million now. The cool thing about this mess is that it is telling me exactly what I need to do better so this mess is basically telling me that I need to do a better job at prioritizing putting the day away after every single day. So next week I'm going to make it a priority to spend like 10-15 minutes at the end of each day to put things away. 'cause this literally would not be here if I just put it away. The day that I took it out next, I'm going to take out this foldable cart that I got from Amazon. This thing is a lifesaver if you live in an apartment. I use it for groceries. Sometimes I use it to take the trash out. The trash chute. It's great, but I'm gonna take this out today to take these boxes to the recycling bin upstairs. Plate and utensil to use for upcoming week. And I also like to clean my sink on Sundays too. I like to clean my sink like this every week to avoid my sink from being like super nasty in the future. So I let that baking soda mixture sit in the sink for like 5 minutes and then I scrub and rinse it away. Then I take these fizzy safety odorizers and I just throw it down the drain. So I am going back in the stairs, but instead of like taking this big long thing and trying to vacuum the stairs, the cool thing about this Dyson is. There's like a shorter attachment for it, so you just unlatch it down here. So you get the vacuum portion and then you just attach this. Can boom. This is my best adult purchase of all time. I love this thing. Quote unquote the room. It's just like a closet and I use this drying rack to dry certain items that I can't tumble dry, 'cause I don't wanna ruin my clothes prematurely. Since I've been on my feet all day, I decided to take like an hour rest and just read a book just to chill out and read a book. Now I'm gonna clean my bathroom counter and sink. I actually got to fill myself in my counter, but usually I try to do maybe like every other week is. I boil a few cups of vinegar. I know it sounds weird, but I sprinkles baking soda. Make sure in the bathroom sink and once that vinegar is boiling I'll pour it down the drain so the chemical reaction makes this mixture bubble and it \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Before you probably even seen one before, but you're probably like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know exactly what that is. Essence is a total like product that is full of active ingredients that penetrates the skin to deeply nourish, hydrate and balance it. It also allows your other product in your routine to absorb better into the skin, so let me give you a little visual. Imagine your skin is like a sponge and you put dish soap on a dry sponge. It doesn't penetrate the sponge, does it? But if you want the sponge with water, that one ball starts rolling, so it's similar to your skin when you apply theorems in Oculus to dry skin, it doesn't. Your skin doesn't really absorb the product that well because the product isn't absorbing into skin. It's not penetrating the skin. Your skin is down from an essence, however, your serums and your uncles? They will penetrate the skin better and your skin will absorb these products better, which will lead to. Corners and hydrates, and so you're probably asking, well, isn't that like basically a toner, not twice. This is our bigger than toners are like thicker in consistency, but they also have a lower molecular weight than serums do, so they're bigger than serum and also because of that lower level wait they're able to penetrate the skin on a deeper level. They also contain more active ingredients that owners do, and they also contain a higher concentration of active ingredients that owners do, but not by as much as serums. So basically, not only do essences hydrate, nourish and balance the skin, but they also serve kind of like as a transporter to transport your other products more deeply into skin to penetrate your skin deeper and give you make the product more effectively. Where did essences come from? Essences are extremely extremely popular in Asia. They originated in Asia and based on my research that I've done since like products have existed in Asia since like the 1800s, they're often considered the hearts of agency in care because agent skin care routines tend to focus way more on hydration than Western routines do. If you've ever seen like the glass skin trend or you ever watched like a drama and you were totally mesmerizing people jealous at how hydrated and nourished everyone skin looked, it's usually a result of dehydration and the nurse that in essence can give you. In other words, we stand essences in this House. We love hydration, hydration, popular belief. Dry skin is not the only skin type that can benefit. In fact, when I started focusing on hydration, my oily skin actually started to get less oily, contrary to another popular belief, moisturizers don't actually hydrate the skin, they just prevent hydration from \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","To a lot of people.

I didn't have any decor, I didn't handed down your table. I didn't hear I didn't have coffee table. Couch rugs. Also like there's forks and knives that you don't even think about. There's like a pizza cutter. Need a pasta strainer? I'll put together a list of all the things I have to buy. If you wanna know like the. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Is it the other closet? This is just a shoe rack. Shoes that don't need to go in my bedroom closet because I'm not gonna kill. Everybody's like offseason and then these are coats. I don't really tell that like obviously these coats. Then you walk in and this is the kitchen area and the dining room area. And then be like living room area. This is pretty much the view from the front door. The whole vibe of the room and the kitchen was modern farmhouse in the dining area is more French country. I wanna show you guys how great it is in here 'cause I found this at night but like even with the blinds closed it gets so much natural light. There's literally no lights on right now in the house. That's my couch usually looks like it's why I don't wanna get dirty. Those blinds are closed and that one is closed even with like. All of the closed. This room still gets so much light. This is what it looks like with the blinds open. I don't wanna show you the blinds like I know for obvious reasons. But yeah, this is no lights on so that's a lot of money on electric. You turn around. This is how I decorated my little ladder shelf. I have these from Hobby Lobby. Someone says something about Hobby Lobby. I don't remember it was, but I'm sorry I didn't know about it before I shop there. These pants from Hobby Lobby that was a gift. The candle have my flowers. Those are from like literally a year or two ago. That's from home goods and this is in collection. Is that frame and that was a gift in the middle of the candle that's from goodwill and I put some plants in it. You gotta have cotton in your country? Come on, that was really pretty actually from home goods. Pretty cheap. This pumpkin. I love the detail. This was a gift to the clock. I really like how this turned out. I wanna put some artwork like right here. I'm thinking something round. I'm not. I haven't found like a perfect piece yet though. There's a TV and the credenza my mom told me that word is I used in my old house as a desk. It was actually pretty cheap. I got it at home goods. There was like a scratch of pen on it like a ribbon penmark they gave me just always ask for discount. This is where I keep my keys and my mask. But it's my tattoo on a mask. I link down below my friend even for me and she was like I can sell them to your subscribers. A few of you wanted black so she actually made some black tail.
